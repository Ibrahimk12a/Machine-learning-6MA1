# King County House Sales Analysis

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It's a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models.

### Lab Objective
In this lab, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand how different features affect house prices. I analyzed the distribution of prices and living areas, and investigated the relationship between price and key variables like square footage (`sqft_living`), construction grade, and location (`zipcode`).
